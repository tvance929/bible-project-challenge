The New Testament writers show us that followers of Jesus carry the responsibility to live as royal priests forward into eternity, reclaiming the lost calling God gave humanity to represent him and rule the world on his behalf. And the story of the Bible ends where it began: in a garden with humans serving and ruling as God’s royal priests forever.",

Throughout Israel’s story, God raises up leaders to be this royal priest, but they all fall short. But their stories point forward to the ultimate royal priest, Jesus. In this video, we’ll explore how Jesus is the ultimate king and priest who invites humans back into Eden so that we can once again take up our calling as God’s royal priests.",
